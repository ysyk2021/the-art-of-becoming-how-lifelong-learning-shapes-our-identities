Understanding Lifelong Learning

Lifelong learning is not limited to a specific time period or educational institution. It is a mindset and a commitment to self-improvement and personal growth that transcends traditional educational boundaries. Lifelong learners actively seek out opportunities to expand their knowledge, adapt to new challenges, and develop their skills at any stage of life.
