Despite the benefits, there are also challenges associated with online learning, including:

* Lack of structure: Online learning requires self-motivation and discipline to stay on track, which can be a challenge for some learners.
* Limited social interaction: Online learning can lack the social interaction and networking opportunities of traditional in-person courses.
